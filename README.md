# Pima_Diabetes_ANN

Diabetes means blood sugar is above desired level on a sustained basis. The prime objec-
tive of this research work is to provide a better classification of diabetes. There are already several existing 
method, which have been implemented for the classification of diabetes dataset. In medical sector, the clas-
sifications systems have been widely used to exploit the patientâ€™s data and make the predictive models or 
build set of rules. 

We are using the Artificial Neural Network(ANN) for  Classifications.

# ANN
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are multi-layer fully-connected neural nets that look like the figure below. They consist of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Every node in one layer is connected to every other node in the next layer. We make the network deeper by increasing the number of hidden layers.
As a summary, ANNs are very flexible yet powerful deep learning models. They are universal function approximators, meaning they can model any complex function. There has been an incredible surge on their popularity recently due to a couple of reasons: clever tricks which made training these models possible, huge increase in computational power especially GPUs and distributed training, and vast amount of training data. All these combined enabled deep learning to gain significant traction.

# Description About The Data
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
